                  Inquisitive and devotee, I like developing my skills in several fields, computing, electronics, music or sport. <br><br>
                  I spend a lot of free time to develop more and more complex projects in DevOps, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development and Applications, and Mobile Apps. <br>
                  I attended several online courses on Full-Stack Web Development, Cross-Platform Mobile Apps. I also took some courses on artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, giving me the opportunity to realise a lot of interesting projects like a simulated autonomous car, or some classifier algorithms. <br><br>
                  I practise table tennis for 7 years as player, trainer and coach, and running for 6 years. Moreover I become initiated to piano for few months.

                  For some years now, I am interested in research, particularly applied to any Artificial Intelligence methods. <br><br>
                  After an internship in this field, during which I had the chance to work on subject mixing Artificial Intelligence and Model-Driven Engineering. <br><br>
                  Since March, I've signed two new contracts with two different research teams, both pertaining with ESEO Tech. The first one is <a style="color: inherit;" target="_blank" href="https://eseo.fr/recherche/les-groupes-de-recherche/gsii/">GSII</a>, working on seismic projects and the second one is <a style="color: inherit;" target="_blank" href="https://eseo.fr/recherche/les-groupes-de-recherche/eris/">ERIS</a>, working on AI and MDE projects applied in various fields.
